                    Working with Liberia's Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, we developed the Liberia
                    Project
                    Dashboard, an innovative system which transforms the management of aid and public investment
                    management
                    in the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Dashboard is currently the only system in the world which automatically updates financial data
                    from
                    donors – significantly increasing data quality and the sustainability of the system. It's
                    lightweight
                    and user friendly, but has a wide range of features to meet the needs of emerging economies.
